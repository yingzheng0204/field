# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
#   This class is a tool to parse a PSCF "field file" and store 
#   all values within it in a single object. A field file contains both
#   a block of text representing the field file header and a subsequent
#   block of text containing all the field data. Field files for all 
#   three types of field formats (rgrid, kgrid and basis) can be parsed 
#   and stored by the Field object. For more detail on the three types of  
#   field formats, please refer to the PSCFPP main documentation. Users 
#   can access and modify the stored values of the parameters in the 
#   header and data part after parsing by using specific statements 
#   (commands), and can write the entire object to a file in proper 
#   format.
#
#   Parsing a field file:
#
#       A Field object represents a PSCF field file that always contains 
#       two parts, a header part and a data part. It stores all the
#       contents within the file in a form that allows each value
#       within it from each part to be accessed and modified.
#
#       The header part always starts with the format version number
#       and the data part follows right after the header without any
#       empty lines. Users may parse such a file by creating a Field 
#       object, passing in the name of field file as an argument. The
#       constructor parses the file and return a Field object that
#       contains its contents.
#
#       Example: To read and parse a field file with name 'field',
#       execute the following code within a python3 interpreter: 
#
#           from pscfpp.field import *
#           f = Field('field')
#
#       A Field object can be written to a file by calling the 
#       writeOut() method, passing in the string of the file name to 
#       which the Field should be written.
#
#           Example: f.writeOut('fieldOut')
#
#   Accessing elements:
#
#       A Field object contains three members, header, data and type,
#       corresponding to the different sections of the field file and 
#       its field format. Users can retrieve any member by dot notation:
#
#           1. header: the header member can be accessed by calling the
#              'header' attribute, which returns a dictionary that stores
#              all the properties in the header. All stored contents within 
#              it can be accessed by the formats listed below:
#              Example: 1. accessing the whole header:
#                          f.header 
#                       2. accessing single property in the header:
#                          f.header['format']    or
#                          f.header['N_monomer']
#
#           2. data: the data member can be accessed by calling the 'data'
#              attribute, which returns a list of lists that stores all 
#              the data of the field. A single row of data can be accessed 
#              by corresponding row number. Any specific data points can be 
#              accessed by corresponding two separate square bracket indices.
#              Example: f.data    or
#                       f.data[4]    or
#                       f.data[0][6]
#
#       The parser also allows users to modify the properties of the header 
#       in the preset format. Users have to modify the desired properties 
#       with the same types of objects for the original ones, otherwise,
#       the parser will not work as expected.
#
#       Example: f.header['dim'] = 3    or
#                f.header['cell_param'] = [2.45]   or
#                f.header['group_name'] = 'P_1'
#
#
# Module Contents:
#
#   class Field:
#           A Field object contains all the data from a field file. It
#           has three members, header, data and type, where the header member
#           contains all the data in the header of the field file starting
#           with the format version, the data member contains all the data of
#           the field, and the type member stores the field format. This class 
#           parses a field file and stores all contents within it in a form
#           that allows all properties and data to be accessed and modified.
#
#   def getValue(v):
#           A function to distinguish the correct type of the value from the 
#           passed-in string, v, and return it with the correct type.
